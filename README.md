# Interactive portfolio
is a personal project made with Unity 6 and WebGL.
This portfolio is supposed to show off my skills as a Unity developer. 
The goal of the webpage is to have a complete project from the beginning to an end showing off my ability to achieve goals and assemble complete projects, as well as an ability to integrate **informative** with **interactive**.

### Models used are taken from the Unity Asset Store.
